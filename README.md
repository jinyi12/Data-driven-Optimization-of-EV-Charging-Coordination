# Data-driven-Optimization-of-EV-Charging-Coordination

This project explores data-driven optimization for EV charging coordination at a parking deck. The optimization problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization of EV charging coordination at a parking deck, with varying solar generation scenarios. Data utilized in this project includes Malaysia's solar irradiance data for the year 2020. All other data are generated and simulated.

## To generate solar generation scenarios
Run 
```{python}
`python generate_solar_scenarios.py`
```
